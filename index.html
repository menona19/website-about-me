      <h3> About Me: </h3>
      <h4> I was born in Palo Alto and moved to Cupertino at the age of three. I attended Villa Montessori for Pre-School and went to Collins Elementary, Lawson Middle, and Cupertino High School. I am 16 and going to Junior year this Fall. My family consist of my brothers - one older and one younger - my parent, and my dog. I enjoy spending time with them and with my friends. My favorite places to visit in Cupertino are the many boba places and target. </h4>

      <h3> Extracurricular Activities: </h3>
      <h4> I have been taking Karate classes for about 9 years. I have just completed by black belt test and am waiting for my results. I enjoy karate because it is a way of getting fit and a way to let go off your stress. SImilarly, I have also been taking dance classes for about 6 years. I take jazz, tap, and hip-hop classes, However, I used to also take ballet and lyrical, I stopped because it was too much for me to handle with school and all. I love dance because it is a way of self-expression. I have many wonderful friends for dance and I am really grateful for meeting them! </h4>
